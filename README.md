# Check this out
Built a fetch api request to get names, eye color and skin color of random star wars characters using javascript DOM.
It is possible to get this error message "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource" while trying this out.
## API change
Changed the api from "https://swapi.dev/api/people/" to "https://swapi.py4e.com/api/people/"
